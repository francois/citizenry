= Citizenry

Similar in concept to [Banished](http://www.shiningrocksoftware.com/game/), Citizenry sets the player up to control a
group of citizens and make them survive and flourish in a hostile world. The setting is a fantasy, medieval age like
world, where goblins and orcs may live. Players may build houses and forts, to help defend their settlement.

I like resource management games and tower defense games. This is motivation enough to build something like this.
